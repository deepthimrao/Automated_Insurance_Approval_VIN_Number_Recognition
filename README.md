# Automated Insurance Approval VIN Number Recognition
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models have been developed for the 
recognition of printed text. One such task is to identify the Vehicle Identification 
number (VIN) from images taken during the approval of an insurance claim.
VIN number is a unique 17-digit alpha-numeric code used in the automobile industry 
to identify any vehicle as defined by the ISO (International Standard for 
Organization). 
We have built a deep learning model with 2 different 
architectures â€“ CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) based and 
DCNN (Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) based, to identify VIN 
number from images. We achieved an accuracy of 74% with CRNN and 79% with 
DCNN models.
